registry
========

A simple membership registry with a command line interface

## Running the program

This is a command-line program written in PHP. You will need a terminal and have `php`
in your path to run it.

Open your terminal and run:

    # open the root folder
    cd /path/to/registry/

    # start the app
    php index.php

## Standards

- [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/);
- PHP-DOC blocks use the short, lower case version of types (int, bool, etc...)
- PHP-DOC blocks can be merged documenting several member variables at once

## Documentation

There are a few examples in the documentation that **need** to be run from the root folder:

    php docs/example.php
