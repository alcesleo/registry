registry
========

A simple membership registry with a command line interface

## Standards

- [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/);
- PHP-DOC blocks use the short, lower case version of types (int, bool, etc...)
- PHP-DOC blocks can be merged documenting several member variables at once

## Documentation

There are a few examples in the documentation that **need** to be run from the root folder:

    php docs/example.php
